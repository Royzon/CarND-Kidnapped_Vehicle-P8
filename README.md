# **Kidnapped Vehicle Localization with a Particle Filter**

### Objective
The Vehicle has been "kidnapped" and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location and 
a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location. Then the vehicle starts to move, in the meanwhile, it records 
the noisy sensor and control data. A real-time particle filter is implemented to localize the vehicle with 
 the sensor data.

In this project, particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to 
what a GPS would provide). At each time step my filter 
will also get observation and control data.

**Demo Explanation**: 
* Inputs:
    * one map contains landmarks
    * one initial location (e.g GPS) in the very beginning with big uncertainty.
    * noisy landmark observations in each timestamp while vehicle is moving.

* Outputs: 
    * The **blue circle** (with an black arrow inside) is the real-time estimation of the vehicle's location 
      and heading orientation from the particle filter.

* Ground truth: 
    * The **blue car** is the ground truth of the vehicle, including position and heading orientation. 
    It is only visualized for comparison purpose.
